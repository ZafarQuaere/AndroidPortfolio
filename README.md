## Detailed Setup Guide

For a complete step-by-step setup guide, see [LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## Portfolio Sections

The application includes the following main sections:

- **Header** - Navigation bar with smooth scrolling links
- **Hero** - Introduction and call-to-action section
- **About** - Personal information and background
- **Skills** - Technical skills and expertise
- **Experience** - Professional work history
- **Projects** - Showcase of development projects

### Customizing Content

Portfolio content is managed through mock data files in `src/data/mock.js`. You can easily customize:

- Personal information
- Skills and technologies
- Work experience
- Project details
- Contact information

### Component Structure

The application uses a modular component structure:

```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ portfolio/          # Main portfolio sections
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hero.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ About.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Skills.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Experience.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Projects.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Contact.jsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.jsx
â””â”€â”€ ui/                # Reusable UI components
    â”œâ”€â”€ button.jsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ card.jsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ badge.jsx
    â””â”€â”€ ... (30+ components)
```

## Deployment Guide
Frontend
- Build: `cd frontend && yarn build` (outputs to `frontend/build`)
- Host on Netlify/Vercel/S3+CloudFront or any static host

Backend
- Deploy FastAPI with Uvicorn on Render/Fly.io/Heroku/AWS/GCP/Azure
- Set environment variables (`MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME`, `CORS_ORIGINS`)
- Use MongoDB Atlas for managed Mongo

Configuration
- Ensure `CORS_ORIGINS` includes the deployed frontend origin
- Point the frontend to the deployed API URL via `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`

## Contributing & Coding Standards

This project follows strict coding standards and best practices to maintain code quality and consistency. All contributors must adhere to these guidelines.

### Quick Reference
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS with camelCase variables, PascalCase components
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI with snake_case conventions
- **Commits:** Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- **Testing:** Maintain 80%+ test coverage for new features
- **Documentation:** Update relevant docs with any changes

### Detailed Standards
For comprehensive coding standards, architecture guidelines, testing requirements, and best practices, see:
**[Coding Standards & Best Practices](.cursor/rules/coding-standards.md)**

### Development Workflow
1. Review existing codebase for similar functionality
2. Follow established patterns and conventions
3. Write tests for new features
4. Run linting and formatting tools:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && yarn lint && yarn format
   
   # Backend (in venv)
   black . && isort . && flake8 .
   ```
5. Create meaningful commit messages
6. Submit PR with clear description and tests

### Code Quality Tools
- **Frontend:** ESLint, Prettier
- **Backend:** Black, isort, flake8, mypy
- **Testing:** Jest (frontend), pytest (backend)

## Troubleshooting
- Backend fails to start: ensure `backend/.env` exists and MongoDB is reachable
- CORS errors in browser: add the frontend origin to `CORS_ORIGINS`
- Frontend cannot reach API: verify ports and base URL, check network errors in DevTools
- Dependency issues: delete `frontend/node_modules`, reinstall (`yarn`), and retry
- Linting errors: run `yarn lint --fix` (frontend) or `black . && isort .` (backend)
